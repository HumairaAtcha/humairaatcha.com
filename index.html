                                data-footer="As part of the Thirty Logos Challenge where you are sent a logo design brief over the course of 30 days, I had to create a logo for a company that rents out office spaces as my first challenge. <br><br>
                                             The Brief: <br> <i> I'm Mary, the project coordinator at Space. We're so happy to have your work on our logo design! Space is building co-working offices so that freelancers and small startup companies have a stunning office to work out of without paying the big bucks to buy or lease a large building.
                                             We offer rentable offices for teams of 1 to 12 in beautiful areas across the world including Austin, New York City, Raleigh, Chicago, San Francisco, and London. These offices are also great for people working remotely for larger companies.
                                             For the Space logo, we want to capture the idea of a personal, modern, and fun shared office space. We would be open to some kind of icon or using the text 'Space' to represent the company.
                                             We don't have any requirements in terms of colours, text, icon, or otherwise. Have fun with some ideas! And if this helps, some of our competitors are Industrious and WeWork.</i> <br><br>
                                             When I thought of the word 'Space', the colours that came to mind were blues and greys. Initially, there was green in the colour palette; however, I decided to remove it as I thought there were too many different colours.
                                             The reason for choosing the letter 'a' to be white was to show a bit of expressive typography. Pointing out there is space within the logo. I created these simple business cards showing my designs and the colour choices.">

                                             This magazine I created in college includes a comprehensive background of a Graphic Designer and Art Director - David Carson. He has won 100s of awards just for his work and influenced many to break boundaries and to explore things outside the box. <br><br>
                                             These particular pages were encouraged by the work of Carson's. I placed a photograph of Carson in the middle of the page layout to give a direct mode of address to the reader.
                                             Some fonts are bigger and bolder than the rest of the paragraphs which are made to stand out, as some are inspirational quotes from Carson himself. The overlapping of these pictures and texts was influenced by Carson's posters.">

                                             On a separate piece of paper, I had drawn the Liverpool Cathedral using the continuous line technique. I scanned both artworks into Photoshop to create the collage you see. <br><br>
                                             The artwork on the right-hand side was a similar process; however, for the background, I used ink and paint which I then blew around with a straw to create a splat effect.">

                                             The right-hand page includes Carson's design for the 1992 issue of alternative rock-n-roll magazine named 'Ray Gun'. He experimented with typographic designs in the 3 years he was with them, which broke the traditional layout scheme as they were 'chaotic, abstract style, not always readable, but distinctive in appearance'.
                                             Since I had used his piece of work on one whole page, I tried to keep the layout simple. I used his style of grunge typography to give the page some colour.">

                                             This piece of work was Carson's cover and December page design for surf photographer extraordinaire Ted Grambeua's 2014 calendar. Typography is used simply for giving the viewer the date on the calendar. However, although the typography is very deconstructed, it is easy to read. You can establish the entire mood of the page layout by emphasising a particular colour scheme.
                                             Here, the blues and greens imply cool and refreshing, which works well with it being on a surf calendar. I used his piece of work as the background as it was already overpowering.">

                                             I decided to go for the simple yet different typography designs, the reason for this was that back then I was new to Photoshop and Illustrator so I did not understand what I could do.
                                             I selected 3 various font styles from dafont.com which I thought worked well collectively. I fiddled around with it, added the generic Christmas colours and stuck with it.
                                             I did not do much research as we were only given one lesson to complete our design, but with that being said, I was Runner-Up! My design was actually placed inside the card as the message.">

                                             I tried to use a colourful colour palette; however, I didn't want the colours to be overpowering.">

                                data-footer="As part of the Thirty Logos Challenge where you are sent a logo design brief over the course of 30 days, I had to create a logo for a coffee shop as my second challenge. <br><br>
                                             The Brief: <br> <i> We're a small coffee shop chain located in Seattle, WA with five locations. Our current logo is just text using a default font but now it's time for an update!
                                             The Grind prides itself on natural and local ingredients. For our new logo, we actually do not want to use any browns! So many coffee shops around here use brown and we'd like to stand out. Maybe oranges, green, other earth tones, etc. could work well.
                                             This logo will primarily be used as our store sign, on menus, and on coffee cups and merchandise. The Grind logo could be text-based or have an icon, we're open to either/both. We're open to using symbols that represent coffee such as the coffee bean, plant, grounds, coffee cup, etc.! </i> <br><br>
                                             As the client did not want the colour brown to be used on the logo since it was seen as a cliché, I went with their suggestion of using earth tone colours. I used a lot of simple shapes and pieced them together to create a vector of a coffee cup.
                                             However, the leaves in the background were not my own. Personally, I believe this logo could work without the text and vice versa.">
